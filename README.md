# Calib

Some Addenda to the paper version.

This repository is related to a paper version of my recent work about calibration. It prensents some Gifs about training which couldn't be stored in the paper version and can't be understood on their own.

Two animations to clearly understand the learning process of the parameters during the training. The main purpose of these animations is to see the distribution of the parameters during the training given the fact that we know the real distribution of the parameters. This is a good way to inspect what the model is really learning and howe fficient the learning is.
